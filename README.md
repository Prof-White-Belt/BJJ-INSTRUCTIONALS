## App Description

**BJJ Instructionals** is a full-stack web application built using the MEN stack (MongoDB, Express, Node.js) with EJS templates. The app allows users to browse BJJ instructionals, add them to a shopping cart, and "purchase" them to store in a personal video library. Additionally, users can write blog-style reviews to recommend instructionals and view posts written by the community.

This app is inspired by training platforms like **BJJ Fanatics** and built to showcase core full-stack skills, including:

- Session-based authentication
- CRUD functionality
- User authorization
- RESTful routing
- Database relationships
- Clean UI/UX design
